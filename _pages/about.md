  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a PhD candidate (writing up) at the University College London (UCL) under the supervision of <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/3849-nadia-berthouze">Prof Nadia Berthouze</a>, <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/54637-youngjun-cho">Prof Youngjun Cho</a> and <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6806-kevin-chetty">Prof Kevin Chetty</a>. I focus on developing machine learning algorithms for novel sensing systems in healthcare. I am investigating multimodal machine learning to allow the model to automatically learn communicative features from multisensory data without human intervention and the need for label-hungry labelled data towards robust performance under various real-life scenarios. I am currently developing a novel multisensory sensing system that can recognise and understand human body behaviours across various domains.</p>
  
  <p>Prior to joining UCL, I studied Artificial Intelligence (MSc) under the supervision of <a href="https://vradu.uk/">Dr Valentin Radu</a> and Electronics and Electrical Engineering (BEng), supervised by <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-tughrul-arslan">Prof Tughrul Arslan</a>, at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
