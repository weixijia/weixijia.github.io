  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a PhD candidate (writing up) at the University College London (UCL) under the supervision of <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/3849-nadia-berthouze">Prof Nadia Berthouze</a>, <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/54637-youngjun-cho">Prof Youngjun Cho</a> and <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6806-kevin-chetty">Prof Kevin Chetty</a>. I focus on developing machine learning algorithms for novel sensing systems in healthcare. I am investigating multimodal machine learning to allow the model to automatically learn communicative features from multisensory data without human intervention and the need for label-hungry labelled data towards robust performance under various real-life scenarios. I am currently developing a novel multisensory sensing system that can recognise and understand human body behaviours across various domains.</p>
  
  <!-- <p>I also serve as a visiting scholar at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/locations/cambridge-uk/">Nokia Bell Labs</a> after I did my PhD internship, where I worked on acoustic sensing in healthcare.</p> -->
  
  <p>Prior to joining UCL, I studied Artificial Intelligence (MSc) under the supervision of <a href="https://vradu.uk/">Dr Valentin Radu</a> and Electronics and Electrical Engineering (BEng), supervised by <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-tughrul-arslan/">Prof Tughrul Arslan</a>, at the University of Edinburgh.</p>

=======
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
