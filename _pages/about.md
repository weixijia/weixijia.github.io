<p>Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>

About Me
======
I am currently a PhD student at University College London (UCL) under the supervision of 
<a href="https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/people/nadia-berthouze/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Nadia Berthouze</a>, <a href="https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/people/youngjun-cho" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Youngjun Cho</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute/about-us/people/academic-staff/kevin-chetty" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Kevin Chetty</a>. I focus on developing machine learning algorithms for novel sensing systems in healthcare. I am investigating multimodal machine learning to allow the model to automatically learn communicative features from multisensory data without human intervention and the need for label-hungary labelled data towards robust performances under various real-life scenarios. I am currently developing a novel RF-fusion sensing system that can recognise and understand human body behaviours across various domains.

I also serve as a visiting scholar at <a href="[https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-tughrul-arslan/](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/locations/cambridge-uk/#gref)" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Nokia Bell Labs</a> after I did my PhD internship, where I worked on acoustic sensing in healthcare.

Prior to joining UCL, I studied Artificial Intelligence (MSc) under the supervision of <a href="https://vradu.uk/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Dr Valentin Radu</a> and Electronics and Electrical Engineering (BEng), supervised by <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-tughrul-arslan/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Tughrul Arslan</a>, at the University of Edinburgh.
